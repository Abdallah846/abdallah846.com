<h2>About Cuttlefish</h2>
<h3>Masters of Camouflage</h3>
<p>Cuttlefish are known for their incredible ability to change color and texture to blend into their surroundings. This camouflage is not only used for hiding from predators but also for hunting prey and communicating with other cuttlefish. Their skin contains specialized cells called chromatophores, leucophores, and iridophores, which allow them to produce a wide range of colors and patterns.</p>
<h4>Physical Characteristics</h4>
<p>Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell called the cuttlebone, which helps them control buoyancy. They have eight arms and two longer tentacles that are used to capture prey. Their large, W-shaped pupils give them excellent vision, and they can see polarized light, which helps them detect prey and predators.</p>
<h5>Behavior and Intelligence</h5>
<p>Cuttlefish are highly intelligent and exhibit complex behaviors. They can solve problems, remember solutions, and even learn by observing other cuttlefish. Their ability to communicate through color changes and body language is a testament to their advanced cognitive abilities.</p>
<h6>Habitat</h6>
<p>Cuttlefish are found in shallow waters of the temperate and tropical oceans. They prefer habitats with plenty of hiding spots, such as coral reefs, seagrass beds, and sandy or muddy bottoms. Some species are known to migrate to deeper waters during certain times of the year.</p>
