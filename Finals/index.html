<h2>About Squids</h2>
<h3>Fascinating Creatures</h3>
<p>Squids are from a fascinating group of crustaceans called Cephalopoda. This is a group of smart animals that are so smart they even baffle scientists. They split from humans 500 million years ago! Squids have a complex nervous system and exhibit behaviors that suggest a high level of intelligence, such as problem-solving and communication through color changes.</p>
<h4>Intelligence</h4>
<p>Cephalopods, including squids, are known for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities. They can navigate mazes, open jars to get food, and even use tools. Their ability to learn and adapt to new situations is remarkable, making them one of the most intelligent invertebrates on the planet.</p>
<h5>Physical Characteristics</h5>
<p>Squids have elongated bodies, large eyes, eight arms, and two tentacles. Their bodies are highly flexible, allowing them to squeeze through tight spaces. They also have a beak-like mouth that can crush the shells of their prey. Squids can change color rapidly thanks to specialized cells called chromatophores, which they use for camouflage and communication.</p>
<h6>Habitat</h6>
<p>They are found in oceans all over the world, from the surface to the deep sea. Squids are highly adaptable and can live in a variety of marine environments, from shallow coastal waters to the dark depths of the ocean. Some species are known to migrate long distances in search of food and breeding grounds.</p>
